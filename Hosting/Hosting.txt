Dear Kento Hize (Arina Organization),

Kindly read this entire email carefully and consider printing a copy for your records.

We appreciate your order! Your hosting account is now fully configured, and this email provides you with all the essential information required to start utilizing your new account.

Please note that if you requested a domain name during sign-up, it may not be immediately visible on the internet. This is due to a process called propagation, which can take up to 48 hours. While waiting for your domain to propagate, your website will not be functional. However, we have supplied a temporary URL below for you to use for uploading files in the interim.

Note on New Domain Registrations (if applicable): Please be advised that upon registering a new domain name, our domain registrar is required to send a verification email to your registered email address, in accordance with ICANN rules. You must verify your domain registration promptly. Kindly note that if your domain name remains unverified after 15 days, it will be suspended until the verification is completed. Should the verification email not appear in your inbox, please be sure to check your junk or spam folder. If needed we can resend the email verification. To ensure that you receive your domain name registration verification email without any interruptions, we recommend whitelisting the email address domainverification@publicdomainregistry.com in your email client. This process helps prevent the verification email from being accidentally filtered into your spam or junk folder. By adding this address to your list of trusted senders, you'll be able to promptly complete your domain registration process by confirming your email address through the verification link sent from this address.
